# python_website

This was a simple website example made in my UMGC class, Building Secure Python Web Applications. Using Python, HTML, and CSS. This site is utilizing Flask to operate locally. 

to test this program simply run from the routes.py file after pulling all source files, and go to the port number shown on your web browser. 

This program is able to store usernames and passwords through a register user page. the passwords are also hashed for security purposes, it verifies that usernames are unique, and passwords must follow a specific guideline to be accepted including having to scan through a list of common passwords and if any part of the password matches a series of characters in that list it will not be accepted. current passwords can also be updated. 

The UI of this website is a little rough around the edges but it should be simple enough to navigate.
